## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd my-first-react-app
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add:

```bash
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=your_collection_id
```

For Netlify production deploys, add this server-side environment variable in Netlify Site Settings:

```bash
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
```

The app uses a Netlify function (`netlify/functions/tmdb.js`) in production, so TMDB requests are proxied server-side.

## Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## 📊 Appwrite Setup

This project uses Appwrite to:

- Track search counts

- Store trending movie metrics

Make sure you:

1. Create a project in Appwrite

4. Add required attributes:

    - searchTerm (string/text)
